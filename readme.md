## Process:
1) Seletion:
We select label and statement for our classification task

2) Cleaning, EDA and Preprocessing: Observation of the data, distribution and classes present in the data, tokenizing, stemming and stop-word removal, feature transformation.

3) Models: Applied different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logisitic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Stochastic Gradient descent, Random forest classifier.
